# Car Lot Reader
For reading data from Spokane area used car lots. Developing for a larger future project.

## Usage
No extra installs needed. Just download car_readers.rb and review main.rb for context.
I'm having difficulty developing a universal reader, as HTML layout is varied.
Usage will require some research into the HTML style being used, and you probably have to modify some of the REGEX.
Right now, there is generic formatting from the car_readers.rb classes. Going forward, I plan to have more specific formats for information returned.

## Status
Still under development. Work is being done in spare time.
I've been able to reuse 2 of my classes for other auto sites so far, so I'm hoping that by continuing to chug away at cranking out code, I'll eventually be able to have predefined code for a fair amount of auto sales sites.

## Future Features
Possible class that would accept website, and then the REGEX values for **name**, **price**, and **url**.
