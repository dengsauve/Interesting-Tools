2. Run, and have fun.

*Only supported in Windows 10. I have witnessed a spectacular failure occur on Windows 7, and I will not be bothered to make a fix for a ten year old OS.

## Configuration - Operation

* Set the parameters for bothering time (milliseconds)
* Click Start
* From when you click Start, you have 3 seconds to select the text box of the chat system you're using.
